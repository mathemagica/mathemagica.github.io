  <li>Long bio:</li>
</ul>

<p>Ann Lewis is the CTO of MoveOn.org. She is a technical leader, architect, and active coder with 15 years of experience in software engineering and software management, with a focus on distributed systems and scalability. In her work at MoveOn, she has in-housed tech and hired a tech team, modernized and upgraded MoveOn’s software stack, created and scaled up new systems for MoveOn’s 2016 election tech program and 2017 Resistance programs, and recently co-ran and launched a rebranding effort across all MoveOn web properties. From her vantage point, the worlds of tech and politics aren’t connected enough. This creates opportunities for new collaborations, bringing in best practices from the world of tech to the world of politics and organizing. She’s also interested in bringing best practices from progressive organizing into the tech world, to ensure that the new economies and systems of power that the tech industry is creating are fair and equitable, and that people power can hold both governments and tech accountable.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>I get about 800 emails a week on a slow week, 1200 on a busy week. While I try to eventually respond to all the emails I receive, here are some expectations about when you are likely to hear back from me, and which requests I’ll respond to in which ways.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-advise-my-startup">Will you advise my startup?</h3>
<p>After Trump was elected, lots of tech folks discovered politics, wanted to get involved, and have generated lots of ideas for new tools and apps. As a result, I see a boom in political tech projects and startups, and I get about one request a week to advise a startup. I have domain knowledge in political tech, how organizing teams work, what barriers and opportunities exist, how to actually get new tools adopted, how to scale up actions into tech-enabled movements. So I totally get how I can be useful to you. But I have limited time, and want to spend my time on the most leveraged and equitable possible projects, so here is what you need to do to recruit me as an advisor.</p>

<p>Can you affirm all of these statements?</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have done your homework about the state of political organizing, and the current landscape of tools. This includes: you are on a few progressive organizing email lists, you have responded to at least one progressive organizing group’s call to action, you have done a “high-bar ask” action like canvassing once, you have researched political CRMs and election data sets like the voter file</li>
  <li>You are committed to <a href="#tech-hiring">equitable hiring practices</a>, understand why this is important, and have a plan to hold yourself accountable to recruiting and advertising your jobs to a population of candidates that is representative of the progressive movement</li>
  <li>You care not just about ideas but also about execution. 90% of startups fail, and 50% of large tech projects (at any size company) fail for avoidable execution related reasons. You have a plan for project strategy and managing your software team beyond “hire smart people and let them figure it out”</li>
  <li>You have drafted goals not just for getting your cool idea off the ground, but also goals for reaching some marker of scale, measured in terms of user actions</li>
</ul>

<p>If so, you can reach out to me here (TBD google form)</p>

<p>My advice for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t lead your product pitches with an assumption of technical ignorance.</strong> Most organizers have built elaborate and sometimes massively scaled workflows out of very basic tools, and have a keen sense of how built the right things at the right times, and how to scale. I’d describe them as “people who can build spaceships out of excel spreadsheets.”</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t lead your product pitches with pity</strong>, or with a sense of a savior complex. Yes, you’re probably rich because you’re in the tech industry, and yes most organizers are probably broke. This doesn’t mean that the poor organizers need to be saved by you, it means that even though they probably have as much or more education and relevant experience than you, they chose to do values-aligned work vs get rich. They don’t need to be saved with your tools or ideas, you need to prove you are values-aligned enough to earn their attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Lead your product pitches with specifics</strong>: specific workflows and specific arguments for what value you’re going to add. It’s less likely organizers will hire you for the consulting-style work of doing the thinking for them and help them figure out what problems to solve, and more likely to pay for a tool you’ve built that automates workflows they are currently doing manually.</li>
  <li><strong>Be extremely careful about data privacy.</strong> Nothing will get you a closed door faster than “Can you just hand over your email list?” Keeping member data private and only sharing it with explicit consent is not just a value, it’s a key part of an organization’s health: member trust = member engagement.</li>
</ul>
