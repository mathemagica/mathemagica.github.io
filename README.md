## Events

- [NetRoots Nation 2018 Aug 2-4, New Orleans](https://www.netrootsnation.org/) - the largest annual conference for progressives and organizers. Training: ["Tech=Power: How to Find Good Tech People and Get Them to Do What You Want"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MiIU-3chCyc4iW8z87pjQPAdNhBdxxsgCNYNmntomfk/view) 
- [PDF18 in NYC June 7, 8](https://www.pdf-18.com/) - Personal Democracy Forum is a political tech conference focusing on tech's role creating, strengthening, and securing democracy and its core institutions. I'll be leading a PDFOpen workshop, ["Reverse Engineering the Tech Platforms to Win Campaigns for Change"](http://moveon.org/pdf18techplatforms
) a workshop where organizers can learn about how the incentive structures of big tech companies are used to make decisions, and how to get these companies to respond to collective action. 

## Contact

I get about 800 emails a week on a slow week, 1200 on a busy week. While I try to eventually respond to all the emails I receive, here are some expectations about when you are likely to hear back from me, and which requests I'll respond to in which ways.

- [Conferences and public speaking requests](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeR_FEfTEC7_YIingt-XwZQcnSMH9B6Zw8LupRu-rux5CL7A/viewform) -- this is a google form that submits to a special email addr that I filter to the top of my inbox. I'm likely to respond within a week.
- General Questions: if you cold email me, I'll likely read your email within a month, but may not have the capacity to respond. You can also reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ann_lewis). If your question seems generally useful to a community I'm a part of, I may add it to my [FAQ](#faq).
- Pitch Your Idea: [Progressive Coders Network](https://www.progcode.org/) slack is a great way to reach me if you have a cool new idea. You may also find others in this community to collaborate with. I'm in the #moveon and #spoke channels, and you can DM me there. You can also email my team with your suggestions and ideas at opensource@moveon.org
- Vendor Inquiries: I am generally not open to cold emails from vendors.  
- Startup Advising: see [FAQ](#will-you-advise-my-startup)
- Slacks I'm in: 
  - [Progressive Coders Network](https://www.progcode.org/) in the #moveon and #spoke channels. I check new DMs every 2 weeks.
  - [The Movement Cooperative](https://movement-coop.slack.com/) I check channels and DMs weekly

### Do you run Anne Lewis Strategies?
No. That's [the other Anne Lewis](http://annelewisllc.com/)

### Will you advise my startup? 
After Trump was elected, lots of tech folks discovered politics, wanted to get involved, and have generated lots of ideas for new tools and apps. As a result, I see a boom in political tech projects and startups, and I get about one request a week to advise a startup. I have domain knowledge in political tech, how organizing teams work, what barriers and opportunities exist, how to actually get new tools adopted, how to scale up actions into tech-enabled movements. So I totally get how I can be useful to you. But I have limited time, and want to spend my time on the most leveraged and equitable possible projects, so here is what you need to do to recruit me as an advisor. 

Can you affirm all of these statements?
- You have done your homework about the state of political organizing, and the current landscape of tools. This includes: you are on a few progressive organizing email lists, you have responded to at least one progressive organizing group's call to action, you have done a "high-bar ask" action like canvassing once, you have researched political CRMs and election data sets like the voter file
- You are committed to [equitable hiring practices](#tech-hiring), understand why this is important, and have a plan to hold yourself accountable to recruiting and advertising your jobs to a population of candidates that is representative of the progressive movement
- You care not just about ideas but also about execution. 90% of startups fail, and 50% of large tech projects (at any size company) fail for avoidable execution related reasons. You have a plan for project strategy and managing your software team beyond "hire smart people and let them figure it out"
- You have drafted goals not just for getting your cool idea off the ground, but also goals for reaching some marker of scale, measured in terms of user actions

If so, [DM me on twitter](https://twitter.com/) and let's chat.

### I'm a tech person and I want to help, what can I do?

**Jobs**: MoveOn is often hiring, and you can check out available jobs [here](https://front.moveon.org/careers/). We run rigorous hiring processes for all of our open positions. We appreciate your tech skills and your interest, but please also be advised that because of heightened interest in political tech, and our all-remote workplace, we hire from nationally competitive hiring pools. The tech team's last hiring process had 150 applications for one open position, and we've also seen as many as 250 applications for a single open position.

**Volunteering**: We have several active open source projects [here](https://front.moveon.org/careers/) and you can check out our open source codebases [here](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/). We welcome volunteers to hack on these projects, and join our open source communities. We anchor discussion about open source projects in the [Progressive Coders Network](https://www.progcode.org/) slack, in the #moveon and #spoke channels. This is a great place to come hang out and look for tasks to pick up.

**Ideas**: You can also email us with your suggestions and ideas at [opensource@moveon.org](mailto:pensource@moveon.org)

### I'm a tech vendor, and I want advice on breaking into the political organizing market

My advice for you:
- **Don't lead your product pitches with an assumption of technical ignorance.** Most organizers have built elaborate and sometimes massively scaled workflows out of very basic tools, and have a keen sense of how built the right things at the right times, and how to manage crazy-complicated logistics. I'd describe them as "people who can build spaceships out of excel spreadsheets."
- **Don't lead your product pitches with pity**, or a savior complex. Yes, you're probably rich because you're in the tech industry, and yes most organizers are probably broke. This doesn't mean that the poor organizers need to be saved by you, it means that even though they probably have as much or more education and relevant experience than you, they chose to do values-aligned work vs get rich. They don't need to be saved with your tools or ideas, you need to prove you are values-aligned enough to earn their attention.
- **Lead your product pitches with specifics**: tell your audience about specific workflows your system unlocks and give specific arguments for what value you're going to add. It's less likely organizers will hire you for the consulting-style work of doing the thinking for them, and more likely they'll pay for a tool you've built that automates workflows they are currently doing manually. 
- **Be extremely careful about data privacy.** Nothing will get you a closed door faster than "Can you just hand over your email list?" Keeping member data private and only sharing it with explicit consent is not just a value, it's a key part of an organization's health: member trust = member engagement.

### Represent All Women in Tech

**You're the only technical woman I know, can you explain all the gender in tech stuff to me?** First of all this probably isn't true. Please take a careful look at the other people on the slack channel or email list where you asked this question, and when you notice other women there, take a moment to consider why you didn't think of them in the first place, and how invisible they might feel when they read your comment.

Secondly, I can only represent my experience, and not all women. Being asked to represent the monolith of people who share an identity characteristic with you is an othering experience. We'd all rather be treated like human beings. That being said, you can find some of my opinions on gender and tech [here](https://medium.com/@ann_lewis/what-are-some-ways-to-inspire-girls-to-embrace-technology-3093759034c8) and [here](https://medium.com/@ann_lewis/the-myth-of-the-pipeline-problem-101d8fa1fcba). 

Third, here are several things that women in tech commonly experience, that tend to surprise white men:
- Despite our education and experience, when women meet new tech people, we're expected to establish and firmly defend our credibility or else we'll be immediately written off as not technically credible. This makes first impressions extremely high stakes, and makes social environments that may be comfortable or casual for you inherently a performance for us
- As a corollary, men who identify as being a part of the dominant culture in tech are constantly correcting perceived "errors" or challenging our judgement whenever we speak in any kind of public forum 
- We expect (and regularly experience) ridicule for asking too many or the wrong questions in professional settings

If as you read this you're realizing you don't actually care about the answer to this question-- actually you're running a hiring process and just wanted to try to attract a diverse set of applicants-- I recommend you check out my hiring advice [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qFf5M5QZ-wFjMJUE_vr5YkIhuVJgdi9ORp-wdr4RbAY/view#slide=id.p). 

If you'd like a more detailed answer, perhaps you'd like to [invite me to speak](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeR_FEfTEC7_YIingt-XwZQcnSMH9B6Zw8LupRu-rux5CL7A/viewform) or meet with your team.

### Encouraging Girls In Tech

**I have a daughter and I want her to have the opportunity to be interested in tech like you. What toys did you play with as a kid?** Sorry, but your premise is flawed. Please read [**this**](https://medium.com/@ann_lewis/what-are-some-ways-to-inspire-girls-to-embrace-technology-3093759034c8) instead. It's not just about toys, it's also about entering and navigating a culture of sexism and a currently unchecked system of oppression. But since you as a parent care about your girl, hopefully this means you're willing to be an ally and use your privilege to actively work to dismantle this.

### What Is Your Personal Style?

No one has ever asked me this, or is likely to ever ask me this. But I have a clever response planned just in case: "unintentional normcore."
