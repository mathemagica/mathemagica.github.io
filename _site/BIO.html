<h3 id="long-bio">Long bio</h3>

<p>Ann Lewis is the CTO of MoveOn.org. She is a technical leader, architect, and active coder with 15 years of experience in software engineering and software management, with a focus on distributed systems and scalability. In her work at MoveOn, she has in-housed tech and hired a tech team, modernized and upgraded MoveOn’s software stack, created and scaled up new systems for MoveOn’s 2016 election tech program and 2017 Resistance programs, and recently co-ran and launched a rebranding effort across all MoveOn web properties. Ann believes the worlds of tech and politics aren’t connected enough. This creates opportunities for new collaborations, bringing in best practices from the world of tech to the world of politics and organizing. She’s also interested in bringing best practices from progressive organizing into the tech world, to ensure that the new economies and systems of power that the tech industry is creating are fair and equitable, and that people power can hold both governments and tech accountable.</p>
